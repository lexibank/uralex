## Overview

The UraLex 2.0 basic vocabulary dataset has its origins in the basic vocabulary cognacy dataset collected by the research initiative BEDLAN (Biological Evolution and the Diversification of Languages), funded by the Kone Foundation between 2009-2013. The data has since been revised and expanded in follow-up research projects, including SumuraSyyni (2014-2016), UraLex (2014-2016) and AikaSyyni (2017-2020). The dataset has been compiled especially for the purposes of quantitative language classification/historical linguistics, such as Bayesian Inference of phylogeny.

The bulk of the data was originally compiled by Jyri Lehtinen, the principal compiler of the BEDLAN research initiative's cognacy dataset. It has since been expanded by the UraLex project, with the bulk of the editing work done by Kaj Syrjänen and Jyri Lehtinen. A number of individuals have made contributions to the dataset at its various stages, including Hilkka Ahola, ZoltÃ¡n Balogh, Rogier Blokland, Natalia Chinaeva, Robert Forkel, Nikolett F. Gulyás, Mikko Heikkilä, Katri Hiovain, Terhi Honkola, Sulev Iva, Santra Jantunen, Eino Koponen, Svetlana Lumme, Luke Maurits, Eve Mikone, Arto Moisio, Larisa Ponomareva, Michael Rießler, Tapani Salminen, Merja Salo, Olga Titova, Marja Torikka, Judit Varga, Susanna Virtanen, Kaarina Vuolab-Lohi and Evgenia Zhivotova.

The dataset mainly covers lexical reflexes (e.g. words and expressions) denoting 313 meanings. Most of these meanings (226) come from standardized *basic vocabulary* lists, which cover meanings that are fairly universal, culturally neutral, and generally expressed by semantically and morphologically simple words which are relatively stable over time. Basic vocabulary words also tend to be resistant to being replaced by borrowing or semantic shift (McMahon & McMahon 2005). The 226 basic vocabulary meanings of the dataset cover the contents of three standardized basic vocabulary lists: the Swadesh200 list (Swadesh 1952), the Swadesh100 list (Swadesh 1955), and the Leipzig-Jakarta list (Tadmor 2009). The 87 meanings that are not in the 226 basic vocabulary meanings cover WOLD401-500, a list of 'less basic vocabulary' first introduced in Lehtinen *et al.* (2014).

The lexical reflexes representing each meaning in the dataset have been chosen to be as semantically neutral and context-independent as possible; in other words, they are contemporary general-purpose words or expressions for each meaning. Simple words or expressions have been favoured over complex ones. A language may also have multiple lexical reflexes documented for a single meaning, generally in cases where there are several equally appropriate expressions to denote that meaning.

To ensure consistent quality of the dataset, one individual has been responsible for drawing up the list of representative words for each language, and this list for most of the languages has then been double-checked by one or more language experts or native speakers. The compilers and language-checkers are listed in the `Language_compilers` table of the dataset.

In addition to the recorded gloss, the phonetic transcription in the Uralic Phonetic alphabet and/or International Phonetic Alphabet is included for some of the lexical reflexes.

Each lexical reflex is also associated with multistate characters that reflect what are often referred to as *cognate relationships* - but should more accurately be called *root-meaning relationships* (Chang *et al.* 2015). Root-meaning relationships indicate that the neutral words (i.e. words whose use is not bound to a specific context) occupying a given meaning slot originate from the same ancestral root, initially acquired through inheritance. The words are considered to belong to the same root-meaning set even if they represent different derivations, as long as they share the same historical root and occupy the same meaning slot. For instance, reflexes of the meaning 'animal' in several Saami (North, Inari, Skolt) and Finnic languages (Finnish, Karelian, Ingrian, Western Votic, Estonian and Võro) are based on the same ancestral root, the Proto-Uralic stem *\*elä-* 'to live' (SSA, 102), using different derivational suffixes, and are consequently grouped to the same 'root-meaning' set. In contrast, cognate relationships (in the accurate sense of the word) require the full word, rather than just the root, to share a historical connection through inheritance. Cognates also do not need to occupy the same meaning slot, unlike root-meaning relationships. For example, Komi Zyryan *bi* 'fire', Finnish *päivä* 'day' and North Saami *beaivvás,*, *beaivi* 'sun, day' are considered to be cognate words that originate from a shared Proto-Finno-Ugric form, possibly the Proto-Uralic stem *\*päjwä*, *\*päjwa* 'warm, heat, fire' (SSA, 457). However, they do not form a common root-meaning trait because they do not occupy the same meaning slot. Likewise, the aforementioned reflexes for 'animal', which count as root-meaning forms, would not be counted as cognates, as they are different derivations of a shared root rather than full words with an ancestral connection.

In addition to inheritance from an ancestral language, linguistic items are also transmitted between languages through borrowing. While borrowed words share a root with their source language, they are not considered to belong to the same root-meaning set as their source, even if the donor language belongs to the same language family, since root-meaning sets represent inherited connections rather than lateral connections. For example, the words in the meaning slot for 'left' in Finnic languages (e.g. Est. *kura* 'left') are considered to be of common origin, while the North Saami *gurut* is a borrowing from Finnic defining a different set (EES 193). Similarly borrowings from other language families are separated into their own root-meaning sets. However, the dataset also includes another multistate character column besides the root-meaning sets to reflect *correlate* relationships; these group together words of the same meaning in different languages that share a root-form through either borrowing or inheritance.

For UraLex 2.0, the borrowing information drafted in the first UraLex release has been revised and updated by Mikko Heikkilä and Mervi de Heer. Heikkilä's primary focus was on the Finnic and Saamic languages. De Heer has updated and compiled loanword information for all languages in the dataset. UraLex 2.0 is published in conjunction with a detailed analysis on the contents and dynamics of borrowings in the basic vocabularies of six languages featured in the dataset (de Heer *et al.* 2021).
 
The loanword information concerns the columns `borr_source`, indicating the most likely donour language(s) for the borrowed lexemes, `borr_qual`, marking the certainty and credibility of the loan etymology, and `ref_borr`, containing the reference for the borrowing information. Additional notes on the loanwords can be found in the `etym_notes` column, which gives details on both inherited and loan etymologies when necessary. Mikko Heikkilä provided the reconstructed forms given for some items.

Other commentary on the items is placed into the `general_notes` column. UraLex 2.0 removes the columns regarding the age of the lexemes due to weak attestation of their absolute ages in the literature.

The sources for the borrowed lexemes given in the `borr_source` column were collected from etymological literature. A substantial number of borrowings in Uralex 2.0 were borrowed from ancestral stages of the donour languages into ancestral stages of the Uralic recipient languages (usually referred to as "Proto-X"). They are labelled without the "proto" denominator to eliminate redundancy unless necessary for distinguishing labels. For example, Germanic borrowings in Standard Estonian refer to Proto-Germanic loanwords acquired into Proto-Finnic. Both the older borrowings as well as loanwords from modern languages are assigned into appropriate root-meaning sets as described above. The labels for the donour languages used in Uralex 2.0 are explained in detail in de Heer *et al.* 2021 (see section 2.3). 

A certainty estimate (*possible*, *probable* or *clear*) for each borrowing is marked in the `borr_qual` column. The estimates were given according to evaluations, critical commentary and certainty tags in literature (see de Heer et. al. 2021 for details). *Clear* refers to uncontroversial and transparent borrowings; for *probable* items the literature expresses uncertainty but no compelling alternative etymologies are given; *possible* borrowings still need a thorough evaluation and they have most uncertainty in literature. Information on some newer loanwords from e.g. from Russian is often not included in the limited pool of literature available for smaller Uralic languages and therefore expert evaluation was used to collect them. Etymologist Mikko Heikkilä identified the certainty estimation and the borrowing source for such loanwords (see `ref_borr` column). In these cases, the *clear* status indicates that the loanword is etymologically transparent. *Probable* means that there are minor difficulties in the sound correspondences between the donor and recipient languages although the borrowing is semantically plausible. No *possible* borrowings were identified in expert assessment.


The literature cited in the `ref_borr` column was selected according to guidelines presented in Junttila (2015), which identify suitable literature types for compiling Uralic loanword information. Following this, we used three main types of literature, which are primary research literature on loan etymologies, etymological dictionaries and evaluative etymological literature. During the data collection process, literature dedicated to the specific UraLex languages was prioritized. However, for those languages which do not have their own reliable etymological dictionaries or articles, information was sourced from literature focusing on other languages as well, e.g. the Finnish and Estonian etymological dictionaries (SSA, EES) were used to obtain borrowing information for smaller Finnic languages.  In addition, general dictionaries with loanword information were used when applicable. For instance, the dictionary of Mari (Moisio & Saarinen 2008) pools together views on Mari lexemes of various researchers and also contains loanword information presented by them. This information is used in conjunction with literature dedicated to specific loanword layers. 

We have considered literature where the authors have applied established methodology of comparative historical linguistics, i.e. the study of sounds law and sound substitution. Works that are not based on the methodology and have been clearly rejected by the scientific community (e.g. Gordeev, 1979-1983) were not taken into account. Only those etymological works which have contributed to the borrowing information in basic vocabulary are given in the references, which are not to be taken as a comprehensive list of Uralic etymology. 

The root-meaning relationships and correlate relationships in the current version of the dataset are based on published etymological references, mostly those published before 2014. The loanword information is compiled from literature published by the end of 2020.

The data currently covers 26 Uralic languages: Finnish, Ingrian, Karelian, Estonian, South Estonian (Võro), Veps, (Western) Votic, (Courland) Livonian, Inari Saami, Kildin Saami, North Saami, Pite Saami, Skolt Saami, South Saami, Ume Saami, Erzya, Meadow Mari, Komi-Zyrian, Komi-Permyak, Udmurt, Hungarian, (Sosva) Mansi, (Vakh-Vasyugan) Khanty, Tundra Nenets, Nganasan and Northern Selkup. The data also includes a partial reconstruction of Proto-Uralic.

The dataset also provides several subsets of the included meanings (meaning lists). These include the lists that serve as the basis for the chosen meanings - that is, Swadesh100 (Swadesh 1955), Swadesh200 (Swadesh 1952), Leipzig-Jakarta (Tadmor 2009) and WOLD401-500 (a list of less basic vocabulary from Lehtinen *et al.* 2014). In addition, the dataset also includes a Swadesh207 list (which combines the meanings of Swadesh200 and Swadesh100), the Fullbasic list (which combines the 226 basic vocabulary meanings from Leipzig-Jakarta, Swadesh100 and Swadesh200 as one list) and Ura100 (a Uralic basic vocabulary list introduced in Syrjänen *et al.* 2013). Notably, the Ura100 list, which is based on an older 17-language version of the Uralic dataset, should be regarded as obsolete, and we do not encourage people to use it. In addition to the aforementioned meaning lists, the dataset also includes Leipzig-Jakarta ranks for the meanings that belong to the Leipzig-Jakarta list and the WOLD401-500 list.

Information from the UraLex basic vocabulary dataset or its predecessor, the BEDLAN cognate database, has featured in Honkola *et al.* (2013), Syrjänen *et al.* (2013), Lehtinen *et al.* (2014), List *et al.* (2017) and Tambets *et al.* (2018).
